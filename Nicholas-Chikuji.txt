Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
	a block-level element is an HTML element that begins a new line on the page and extends the full width of the available horizontal space of its parent element.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
	the element is positioned relative to the first relatively positioned parent element. f there is no positioned parent element, it will be positioned related to the HTML element (the page itself).
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
	display: inline-flex

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
	the box model is basically a box that wraps around every HTML element. the box consists of a margin, border, padding, and then the actual content in the middle layer.
	
	'Explanation of the different parts:

	Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
	Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
	Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
	Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
	The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements. '
